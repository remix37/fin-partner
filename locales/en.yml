In addition, consultancies often charge over 20% for their services. At Fin Partners, we guarantee affordable success with full transparency of our payment process alongside our expertise and network in the SAP market.
      - "Our key theme is: TRANSPARENCY. A clear, mutual understanding of your budget and our rates is the key to forming strong long-term partnerships between clients and candidates."
