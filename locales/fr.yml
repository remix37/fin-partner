  what-we-do:
    title: "Our Approach"
    intro:
      - The Recruitment industry is changing. We are witnessing the emergence of startups who believe they can take over the recruitment industry, in part by hiding their fees. In addition, consultancies often charge over 20% for their services. At Fin Partners, we guarantee affordable success with full transparency of our payment process alongside our expertise and network in the SAP market.
      - "Our key theme is: TRANSPARENCY. A clear, mutual understanding of your budget and our rates is the key to forming strong long-term partnerships between clients and candidates."
